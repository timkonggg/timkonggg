## 🧠 Highlight Projects

### 🎮 Multi-Agent RL in Overcooked-AI using CTDE MAPPO

![counter_circuit_o_1order-ezgif com-speed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bf1530e-0903-460a-835d-0d39f6ee623d)

- Trained agents using **MAPPO with Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**.
- Designed reward shaping on subgoals and advantage sharing to foster collaboration.
- Achieved **7–11 soups per episode** with emergent asymmetric behaviors across agents.

### 🚀 Lunar Lander Continuous Control with SAC

![lunarlander](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e59449db-3993-49bc-86c3-ca8f3cc85119)

- Applied **Soft Actor-Critic** to solve LunarLanderContinuous-v3 in Gym.
- Conducted hyperparameter sweeps on entropy, learning rate, and target update rate.
- Observed learning phases: crash → hover → stable landings (> 200 reward).

### 🧱 MeshQuest: Benchmarking and Fine-Tuning Generative 3D Models

![MeshQuest](https://timkongg.github.io/images/meshquest.png)

- Benchmarked **Hunyuan3D, OpenLRM, One-2-3-45, Pixel2Mesh** on 16 stylized low-poly assets.
- Fine-tuned **OpenLRM** on 734 asset dataset with **DINOv2**, **triplane NeRF**, and **TV regularization**.
- Performed **human perceptual survey** and geometric analysis (CD/HD) to quantify improvements.
