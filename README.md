# 👋 Hi, I'm Tim Kong

🔬 **R&D Engineer** with a background in robotics startups and the semiconductor industry, currently pursuing a **Master's in Computer Science (Machine Learning specialization)** at Georgia Tech.

I specialize in:
- Reinforcement Learning & Generative AI
- Computer Vision, Activity Recognition, Multi-Agent Systems
- Full-stack tools and simulation for ML evaluation

## 🧠 Highlight Projects

### 🎮 Multi-Agent RL in Overcooked-AI using CTDE MAPPO

![Overcooked Video](https://timkongg.github.io/videos/counter_circuit_o_1order.mp4)

- Trained agents using **MAPPO with Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**.
- Designed reward shaping on subgoals and advantage sharing to foster collaboration.
- Achieved **7–11 soups per episode** with emergent asymmetric behaviors across agents.

### 🚀 Lunar Lander Continuous Control with SAC

![Lunar Lander Video](https://timkongg.github.io/videos/rl-video-episode.mp4)

- Applied **Soft Actor-Critic** to solve LunarLanderContinuous-v3 in Gym.
- Conducted hyperparameter sweeps on entropy, learning rate, and target update rate.
- Observed learning phases: crash → hover → stable landings (> 200 reward).

![MeshQuest 2](https://timkongg.github.io/images/meshquest2.png)
![MeshQuest 3](https://timkongg.github.io/images/meshquest3.png)

- Benchmarked **Hunyuan3D, OpenLRM, One-2-3-45, Pixel2Mesh** on 16 stylized low-poly assets.
- Fine-tuned **OpenLRM** on 734 asset dataset with **DINOv2**, **triplane NeRF**, and **TV regularization**.
- Performed **human perceptual survey** and geometric analysis (CD/HD) to quantify improvements.
